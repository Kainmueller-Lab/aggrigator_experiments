# Aggrigator Experiments üêä

**Aggrigator** is a lightweight and modular Python library for aggregating uncertainty in deep learning workflows, especially useful for tasks like segmentation or per-pixel analysis.

With an intuitive API and a suite of built-in strategies, Aggrigator lets you:
- Reduce pixel-wise uncertainty maps into scalar scores for ranking or evaluation.
- Apply patch-based, class-specific, or thresholded aggregation strategies.
- Integrate spatial correlation metrics like Moran‚Äôs I or Geary‚Äôs C.
- Compare strategies side-by-side with insightful summaries and plots.

Designed to be modular, explainable, and research-friendly.  
Use it out of the box, or extend it with your own aggregation logic!

## Pre-requisites

Setup the environment by running the following commands. Be careful to choose the right pytorch version for your installed CUDA Version.

```bash
micromamba env create -f environment.yml
micromamba activate aggr_experiments
pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

To make the current directory ```(.)``` importable without changing ```sys.path``` manually:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
